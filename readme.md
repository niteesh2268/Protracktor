How to operate Protracktor
--------------------------
*Getting dependencies ready:
1) Automatically using "installer.sh"
"installer.sh" file which will take care of all the dependencies and requirements for the project.
To run "installer.sh", go to the project directory "Protracktor/source" where "installer.sh" is present and then run the following commands:
    $ chmod +x installer.sh
    $ ./installer.sh
2) Alternatively (If some dependencies are still left, generally should not happen)    
If some requirements are still missed please follow the steps below to manually install the dependencies.
Install "python" on your system by running the following command on your terminal:
    $ sudo apt-get install python3.6
 
    
Screen activity module needs "xdotool" to get windowâ€™s information:
    $ sudo apt-get install xdotool
  
    
For Internet Tracking Module install "nethogs":
    $ sudo apt-get install nethogs
    $ sudo setcap "cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw=ep" /usr/sbin/nethogs
    
    
To install "PyAutoGUI" additionally you need to install the "scrot" application, as well as "Tkinter":
    $ sudo apt-get install scrot
    $ sudo apt-get install python3-tk
    $ sudo apt-get install python3-dev
    $ sudo pip3 install python3-xlibsudo
    $ sudo pip3 install pyautogui
    $ sudo pip3 numpy==1.18.5
    $ sudo pip3 notify2==0.3.1
    $ sudo pip3 matplotlib==3.3.1
    $ sudo pip3 opencv_python==4.1.2.30
    $ sudo pip3 PyQt5==5.15.1
    
*After installing all the dependencies:
Go to the main directory "Protracktor" and in that go to source directory.
After that run the following command in terminal:
    $ python3 main.py
    
This will start the application.


Using the program
------------------
The main window has two tabs namely "Local Proctoring" and "Let's Start".
    1) First enter the course code you want to start proctoring for.
    2) This field is used to name the log files and video files with additional timestamps added as a naming convention for files
    3) Click on "Next" to move to the next tab "Let's Start"
On clicking next after entering the course code you will be directed to the next tab ("Let's Start" tab).

Here there are four check boxes named according to the functionalities they will provide, namely:
    a) Webcam Recording
    b) Screen Recording
    c) Activity Manager
    d) Data usage per app
Check on the required functionalities you want monitored during the proctoring.

***Note***: Internet loss triggered - Webcam and screen recording will only start if there is a loss in internet connectivity detected.
    		This assumes that you are already on some proctoring platform like ms teams initially and if there is a loss of internet connectivity then only webcam recording will start.
    		
After checking on the appropriate check boxes you can start the monitoring by clicking on "Start" button.
After clicking on start a new pop-up window will open.


Notifications
-------------
Two types of notification are issued to the user during the proctoring.
    - When Internet goes down.
    - When Internet comes back.
